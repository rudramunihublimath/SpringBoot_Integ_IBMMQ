10. how to achieve LB in MQ ?  varius ways to perform same ?  Differences between multi-instance queue managers and HA clusters? multi instance setup in MQ ? 
Ans :  https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/7.5?topic=restart-high-availability-configurations

Multi-instance queue managers include the following features:
	Basic failover support integrated into WebSphere MQ
	Faster failover than HA cluster
	Simple configuration and operation
	Integration with WebSphere MQ Explorer

Limitations of multi-instance queue managers include:
	Highly available, high performance networked storage required
	More complex network configuration because queue manager changes IP address when it fails over

17. cold restart in QMGR ? 
Ans :
If your enterprise loses some or all of the log extents needed for restart recovery, the queue manager will be unable to replay the recovery log and so fails to restart. ... This process is known as coldstarting a queue manager.
